# Test-Assignment2

# 1 REFLECTIONS
## 1.1 COMPUTER MOUSE

that it is of the highest quality.*

## 1.2 CATASTROPHIC FAILURE
*Find a story where a software system defect had a bad outcome.*

# 2 TWO KATAS
*Complete the following using TDD. Remember the TDD mantra.*
## 2.1 STRING UTILITY

*Use TDD to create a string utility with the following methods:_
- Reverse string (aBc -> cBa)
- Capitalize string (aBc -> ABC)
- Lowercase string (aBc -> abc)

*Don’t use any built-in string utility – create your own. Remember, the exercise here is to
use TDD, not to deliver a working utility without tests. If there are no tests in the
solution, it won’t be accepted.*

## 2.2 BOWLING GAME KATA
*Complete the Bowling Game Kata using TDD. The slides can be found here:

## 3.2 MOCKING FRAMEWORKS
